## Global Trends in Energy and Emissions

#### Project Overview

This project investigates global trends in energy generation, renewable energy adoption, oil trade, and carbon emissions. Using datasets from 2022–2023, we analyzed the interplay between traditional fossil fuels, renewable energy sources, and carbon emissions across different regions and countries.

#### Key Objectives

- Explore trends in renewable energy production and its impact on electricity generation.
- Analyze oil trade volumes and their correlation with carbon emissions.
- Examine the relationship between renewable energy capacity and carbon emissions.
- Assess the impact of global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on energy and emissions.

#### Datasets

- Renewables - Generation by Source
Contains energy production data for wind, solar, hydro, and other renewables (TWh).

- Electricity Generation by Fuel
Includes fossil fuel-based energy sources: oil, natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy.

- Oil Trade
Tracks imports and exports of crude and refined oil products for 2022–2023.

- Carbon Emissions
Data on carbon dioxide emissions from energy use (1965–2023), segmented by country and region.


#### Key Insights

##### Renewable Energy Trends

- Middle East: Countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE demonstrated significant investments in solar energy infrastructure. Qatar’s renewable energy production increased by over 200% in one year.

- Canada: Hydroelectric power dominated, accounting for 86% of the country's renewable energy in 2023.

- Global Comparison: Countries like the US, Spain, China, and India showcased a diverse energy portfolio, balancing solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear sources.

##### Oil Trade Insights

- Top Exporters: United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE, and Canada.
- Top Importers: Europe, China, Other Asia Pacific, and India.
- Regional Trends: South and Central America showed significant growth in crude exports. Countries like Mexico and Iraq demonstrated a high dependency on refined products, highlighting gaps in refining capacity.

##### Carbon Emissions

- COVID-19 Impact: Global emissions temporarily declined due to reduced economic activity and mobility during the pandemic.

- Regional Trends:
    - Asia Pacific saw the fastest growth in emissions, driven by industrialization in China and India.
    - Developed nations like the US and Japan showed notable reductions, reflecting transitions toward renewable energy.

##### Renewable Energy Capacity vs. Emissions
- Solar Energy: 74% of countries that increased photovoltaic capacity saw a decrease in emissions.
- Wind Energy: 77% of countries with increased wind capacity observed emission reductions.
- Overall: A strong inverse relationship between renewable energy adoption and carbon emissions was evident, with exceptions in rapidly industrializing countries.

##### Future Work
- Economic and Policy Integration: Incorporate GDP, energy subsidies, and policy data to better understand the relationship between economy, energy, and emissions.
- Geospatial Analysis: Explore geographic data to identify trade routes and emission hotspots.
